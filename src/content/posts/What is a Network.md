###### The Royal Spanish Academy (www.rae.es) defines the term as:

10. **f.** Inform. **A set of computers or computing devices connected to each other that allows for the exchange of information.**

In the world of cybersecurity, understanding what a network is and how it functions is fundamental. In general terms, a network is a set of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other. These devices may include computers, servers, routers, switches, and other equipment.

# Network Architecture
The architecture of a network defines how the devices within it are connected and communicate.
## Network Topologies

#### Star Topology: All devices are connected to a central node (usually a switch or hub).

##### Advantage: 
Facilitates management and problem isolation. If a cable or device fails, the rest of the network is not affected.
##### Disadvantage: 
The central node is a critical point of failure; if it fails, the entire network is affected.

#### Mesh Topology: Each device is connected to several other devices, creating multiple communication paths.

##### Advantage: 
High redundancy and reliability; if one link fails, traffic can be rerouted through other paths.
##### Disadvantage: 
High cost and complexity of implementation and maintenance due to the large number of cables and connections.

#### Bus Topology: Each device is connected to several other devices, creating multiple communication paths.

##### Advantage: 
High redundancy and reliability; if one link fails, traffic can be rerouted through other paths.
##### Disadvantage: 
High cost and complexity of implementation and maintenance due to the large number of cables and connections.

#### Ring Topology: Each device is connected to several other devices, creating multiple communication paths.

##### Disadvantage: 
High cost and complexity of implementation and maintenance due to the large number of cables and connections.
